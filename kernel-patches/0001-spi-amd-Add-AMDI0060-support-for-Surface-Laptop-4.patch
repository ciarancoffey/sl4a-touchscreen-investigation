Subject: [PATCH] spi: amd: Add AMDI0060 support for Surface Laptop 4 AMD

The Surface Laptop 4 AMD uses AMDI0060 as the ACPI ID for its SPI
controller instead of the expected AMDI0061/0062/0063. This prevents
the touchscreen (MSHW0231) from working as it's an SPI HID device.

Add AMDI0060 to the list of supported ACPI IDs in the spi-amd driver.
