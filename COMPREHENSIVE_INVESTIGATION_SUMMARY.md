# Surface Laptop 4 AMD Touchscreen Investigation - Complete Documentation

## Executive Summary

**Date**: July 11-12, 2025  
**Device**: Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 AMD (Ryzen 7 4800U)  
**Issue**: MSHW0231 touchscreen completely non-functional in Linux  
**Status**: Root cause identified - ACPI enumeration problem  

**Key Discovery**: The touchscreen is an SPI HID device (MSHW0231), but Surface Laptop 4 AMD has incorrect ACPI enumeration that provides I2C controllers (AMDI0010) instead of the required SPI controllers (AMDI0061/0062/0063).

## Investigation Timeline

### Phase 1: Initial Analysis
- Confirmed MSHW0231 device exists in ACPI but is non-functional
- Found existing linux-surface/spi-hid driver 
- Discovered device was incorrectly targeted by I2C HID patches

### Phase 2: Windows Analysis
- Analyzed Windows device configuration via ProcMon traces
- **Critical Finding**: MSHW0231 is SPI HID device on "SPI bus 11"
- Device uses IRQ 4228, GPIO 2308, works with `hidspi.sys`
- Exposes 8 HID collections (touchscreen is collection 06)

### Phase 3: Linux Investigation
- Built and loaded spi-hid driver successfully
- **Problem Identified**: No SPI controllers exist (`/sys/class/spi_master/` empty)
- AMDI0010 devices bound to i2c_designware driver, not SPI
- MSHW0231 under wrong ACPI parent (AMDI0060 vs SPI controller)

### Phase 4: Internet Research
- **Breakthrough**: Found AMD uses different ACPI IDs for SPI controllers
- Linux `spi-amd.c` driver expects AMDI0061/0062/0063 (not AMDI0010)
- AMDI0010 is definitively I2C-only controller
- Surface Laptop 4 AMD missing proper SPI controller enumeration

## Technical Findings

### Device Information
```
Hardware: Surface Laptop 4 AMD (Ryzen 7 4800U)
Touchscreen: ACPI\MSHW0231 (Compatible: ACPI\PNP0C51)
Current Status: Non-functional (no input events)
Windows Config: SPI bus 11, IRQ 4228, GPIO 2308 reset
```

### Current Linux State
```bash
# Available controllers
/sys/bus/platform/devices/AMDI0010:00 -> i2c_designware driver
/sys/bus/platform/devices/AMDI0010:01 -> i2c_designware driver  
/sys/bus/platform/devices/AMDI0010:02 -> i2c_designware driver

# Missing SPI controllers
ls /sys/class/spi_master/  # Empty

# Device location
/sys/bus/acpi/devices/MSHW0231:00  # Under AMDI0060, no driver bound
```

### Expected Linux State
```bash
# Should have
/sys/bus/platform/devices/AMDI0061:00 -> spi-amd driver
/sys/class/spi_master/spi0/  # AMD SPI controller
/sys/bus/spi/devices/spi0.0  # MSHW0231 as SPI device
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Core Problem
Surface Laptop 4 AMD has **ACPI enumeration bug** where:
1. Firmware declares AMDI0010 (I2C controllers) instead of AMDI0061/0062/0063 (SPI controllers)
2. MSHW0231 touchscreen requires SPI controller but none exist
3. Windows somehow works around this (unknown mechanism)
4. Linux cannot enumerate SPI devices without SPI controllers

### Why All Previous Attempts Failed
1. **I2C HID patches** - Wrong bus type, device is SPI not I2C
2. **SPI HID driver** - Correct driver, but no SPI controllers to bind to
3. **Manual device creation** - Cannot create SPI devices without SPI master
4. **Driver development** - Problem is hardware enumeration, not driver code

## Evidence Documentation

### Windows Analysis Sources
- **ProcMon traces**: `/home/ccoffey/Nextcloud/touchpad/boot-filter.CSV`
- **Device analysis**: `/home/ccoffey/Nextcloud/touchpad/windows_summary_package.md`
- **Registry entries**: Show `hidspi` service binding to MSHW0231

### Linux Investigation Results
- **SPI HID driver**: `/home/ccoffey/repos/spi-hid/module/spi-hid-core.c` (modified with MSHW0231 support)
- **System analysis**: Multiple investigation scripts and dmesg outputs
- **ACPI enumeration**: Confirmed missing AMDI0061/0062/0063 devices

### Internet Research Sources
1. **Linux Kernel Database**: CONFIG_SPI_AMD supports AMDI0061/0062/0063
2. **Kernel Source**: `drivers/spi/spi-amd.c` shows expected device IDs
3. **ACPI Documentation**: AMDI0010 confirmed as I2C-only controller
4. **AMD Platform Info**: SPI controllers use different hardware IDs

## Current Status Assessment

### What Works ✅
- MSHW0231 device detected in ACPI
- SPI HID driver compiles and loads
- Windows analysis provides complete device configuration
- Root cause identified with high confidence

### What Doesn't Work ❌
- No SPI controllers enumerated in Linux
- MSHW0231 cannot bind to any driver
- Touchscreen completely non-functional
- Manual workarounds not possible without SPI hardware

### Blocking Issues 🚫
1. **Missing ACPI devices**: No AMDI0061/0062/0063 in firmware
2. **Hardware mismatch**: I2C controllers present, SPI controllers absent
3. **Enumeration gap**: MSHW0231 under wrong ACPI parent
4. **Driver incompatibility**: spi-amd.c won't bind to AMDI0010

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: ACPI Table Override (Recommended)
**Approach**: Create custom ACPI tables that add proper SPI controllers
```
Difficulty: High
Success Probability: High  
Timeline: Weeks to months
Requirements: ACPI expertise, extensive testing
```

**Steps**:
1. Dump current ACPI tables
2. Create SSDT override adding AMDI0061 device
3. Move MSHW0231 under SPI controller
4. Configure proper resources (IRQ, GPIO, SPI connection)
5. Test with spi-amd and spi-hid drivers

### Solution 2: Hybrid Controller Driver
**Approach**: Create driver that makes AMDI0010 work for SPI devices
```
Difficulty: Very High
Success Probability: Medium
Timeline: Months
Requirements: Hardware documentation, reverse engineering
```

**Steps**:
1. Reverse engineer AMDI0010 dual-mode capabilities
2. Create custom driver that switches I2C->SPI mode
3. Implement SPI controller interface
4. Handle device enumeration manually

### Solution 3: Community Collaboration
**Approach**: Work with linux-surface and upstream developers
```
Difficulty: Medium
Success Probability: High (long-term)
Timeline: 6+ months
Requirements: Community coordination, upstream acceptance
```

**Steps**:
1. Share findings with linux-surface community
2. Collaborate on ACPI override development
3. Submit findings to upstream kernel developers
4. Coordinate with Microsoft for firmware fixes

## Conclusion

This investigation has successfully identified the root cause of MSHW0231 touchscreen failure on Surface Laptop 4 AMD. The issue is **not a driver problem** but an **ACPI enumeration problem** where the firmware provides I2C controllers instead of the required SPI controllers.

The findings provide the linux-surface community with:
- Clear understanding of why touchscreen doesn't work
- Specific technical requirements for fixes
- Evidence-based development direction
- Documentation to prevent duplicate effort

**The path forward is clear**: Fix ACPI enumeration to provide proper AMD SPI controllers (AMDI0061/0062/0063) instead of I2C controllers (AMDI0010), then the existing spi-hid driver should work correctly.
